# healthcare-processes

The BPMN models in this repository are a first attempt to model the healthcare process on a high level of abstraction.
They can be a starting point for a discussion about the implementation of each process together with healthcare professionals.


## BPMN

The processes were created with the online tool https://demo.bpmn.io/s/start

The documentation, examples and a quickstart guide for BPMN can be found at https://www.bpmn.org/

The paper at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437922000217 provides some best practices for modelling healthcare processes with BPMN (see page 9 onward)
